# RC4
This project explores RC4's practical security with 40-bit keys. It includes algorithm implementation, code, and a demo of encrypting and recovering a 64+ character message by an attacker. Assessing vulnerabilities, it documents risks and evaluates break time, shedding light on RC4's security limitations.
